Styled Google Maps
To use Styled Google Maps:
1. Configure the desired style map using any online service that allows you to customize the style
of the map. For Example: https://snazzymaps.com/
2. Open the browser developer tools. Hotkey in most browsers - F12.
3. Find an address request to download any tile. It will look like:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/vt?pb=!1m5!1m4...
4. Open this URL and make sure that the image has a size of 256x256.
5. Copy this address.
6. In Online Maps Inspector select «Provider - Custom», and paste the address in «URL».
7. In the «URL» replace «!1iX!2iX!3iX», to «!1i{zoom}!2i{x}!3i{y}».
It should look something like this:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/vt?pb=!1m5!1m4!1i{zoom}!2i{x}!3i{y}!2m3!...
8. Make sure URL ends at «!4e0» (inclusive). If you have characters after this, delete them.
That's all. You are using Styled Google Maps.
